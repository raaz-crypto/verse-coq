(** * Field arithmetic over GF(2¬≤‚Åµ‚Åµ - 19).


In this module, we implement the field arithmetic over the base field
ùîΩ = GF(2¬≤‚Åµ‚Åµ - 19). we start with considering the representation of
elements of this field.


 *)

(** The underlying prime *)
Definition P : positive := (2^255 - 19)%positive.

(** The underlying Galois field *)
Definition GF := Zmod P.

(** ** Representing elements.


There are two possible representations of elements in this field

* The _packed representation_ as a 255 bit little endian quantity
  represented as 32 bytes. We consider this as 4 -64-bit little endian
  values.

* The _computational representation_: Consider the 255 bit number in
  base 2‚Åµ¬π as Œ± = x‚ÇÄ + x‚ÇÅ 2‚Åµ¬π .... + x‚ÇÖ 2¬≤‚Å∞‚Å¥. Each of the x·µ¢'s
  themselves can be considered as a·µ¢ + b·µ¢ 2¬≤‚Å∂.

* The _intermediate computational form_ is essentially the
  computational representation with a looser bound on the bit size of
  the last limb: the last limb can have 26 significant bits, i.e. 1
  more than its designated 25 bits. Every arithmetic operation is
  designed to work correctly for such inputs and generate output in
  this intermediate computational form.


The packed representation is the standard representation and is in
particular used to storing and transmitting values and is thus
canonical.  The computational representation should be treated as an
implementation dependent internal format and is designed to make the
implementation of the field operation efficient.

The computational representation given by specifying the bit position
of the [i]-th limb which is given by the function [pos i = ‚åà25.5 i‚åâ]
for the natural number [i]. We also have [posP] and [posN] that works
for limb positions of type [positive] or [N].

In the intermediate computational form, certain field element can have
multiple bit representation. The only point at which we fix this is
just before serialisation. This step will be called the cannonisation
procedure.

(** * Carry propagation.

During arithmetic operations, limbs can contain more that their
designated number of bits. In such cases we propagate the bits the
next limb (cycling when we reach the last limb *)



Section CarryPropagation.

  Variable limb    : feVar progvar.

  Program Definition carryFrom (i : nat)(_ : i < nLimbs) :=
    if (i =? 9) then [verse| `19` * (limb[9] ‚â´ `len 9`) |]
    else [verse| limb[ i ]  ‚â´ `len i` |].

  Defined.

  (* We perform a full cycle of propagation by starting at the highest limb *)
  Definition propagate := foreachLimb propagateTo.

End CarryPropagation.


(** ** How many progagations ?

Firstly checking whether any of the carry is actually zero is not such
a good idea (branching based on secret). So the answer is that we run
the propagate one two many times. In the standard representation, we
want to ensure that the ith limb contains [len i] many bits (rest
needs to be propagated further on. We allow for an additional bit at
the top most limb x‚Çâ which will be adjusted after the end of all
operations. Consider the following arithmetic operations

* _Addition:_ Here there is at most one additional bit generated in
  each limb. A single propagation will get all the limbs to the
  intermediate computational form.


* _Multiplication:_ If we think of the limbs as forming a polynomial
  over the indeterminate X then the coefficients c‚Çñ (‚àë a·µ¢ X‚Å±)(‚àë b·µ¢ X ≤)
  will be of the form c‚Çñ = 10 terms of the form a·µ¢ b‚±º * 2 * 19. Which
  is bounded by 2‚Åµ¬≤ * 380 = 2‚Å∂¬π and hence are of 61 bits each.

  Now consider the first round of propagation from c‚Çâ to c‚ÇÄ, c‚ÇÄ to c‚ÇÅ
  ...  c‚Çà to c‚Çâ.  When we started each c·µ¢'s had 61 bits at most and
  hence they propagate at most 62 - 25 = 37 bits in each stage. After
  one cycle of propagation c‚ÇÄ to c‚Çà have their correct number of bits
  but c‚Çâ is a 25-bit number + a 37 bit number = 38 bit number. What
  this means is in the next round we will be propagating 38 - 25 = 11
  bits from c‚Çâ to c‚ÇÄ but then on will only be propagating at most 1
  bit; adding a 11-bit to 25 or 26 bit number will at most result in
  an additional 1 bit carry. As a result after the end of the second
  round of propagation all limbs c‚ÇÄ ... c‚Çà will have the correct
  number of bits but c‚Çâ might have one addition bit (i.e 26 bits
  instead of 25 bits). Therefore after a multiplication it is
  sufficient to do carry propagation twice.

* _Multiplicaiton by small constant_: We can get away by a single
  propagation if the multiplication is by a small constant, or if we
  know that one of the field elements have all their limbs as small.

NOTE: Instead of starting from the largest limb, we could start from
any of the limb but then that particular limb will have an additional
bit. It is better to therefore start the propagation from one of the
25 bit making it 26 bit and our 61 bit bound holds.

(** ** Conditional swapping

Given two field elements A , B and a bit b we want to swap the values
in A and B depending on whether the bit is 1. In order to avoid side
channel information we do the swapping by essentially performing (A,
B) := b B + (1 - b) A, b A + (1 - b) B).

should become all 0's. The setToMask essentially does this.

(** ** Field arithmetic operations.

We implement the following operations for field elements.

1. A := B + C or A += B.

2. A := B - C or A -= B.

2. A := B * C or A *= B.


No explicit propagation is done because as remarked above, the number
of propagations that is to be done depends on the operations that we
are performing and the context.

We start with addition which is more or less straight forward. If we
start with limbs in intermediate computational representation then
after an addition step we will end up with each limb having an
additional bit. A single round of propagation should get it back to
the intermediate computational representation.

Note that one does not need to do a single propagation every time. If
there is a chain of at most 25 additions, we need to do the
propagation only once.

(** ** Subtraction.

Imagine the 255 bit field element Œ± with its bits distributed among
the 10 limbs. Complementing these 255 bits would mean that we replace
the associated integer with 2¬≤‚Åµ‚Åµ - 1 - Œ± where as what we do want to
compute is 2¬≤‚Åµ‚Åµ - 19 - Œ±. So the negation of Œ± is obtained by
complementing and adding the field element -18.

There are two important additional issues.

1. Each limb which has 25 (or 26) bit need to be complemented only on
   those many bits. This also takes care of there being no rounding
   errors when we eventually add this to a field element in
   intermediate form.

2. The field element Œ±, in its intermediate form might have an
   additional bit in its 256 bit position (i.e. Œ± = Œ±‚ÇÄ + b . 2¬≤‚Åµ‚Åµ = Œ±‚ÇÄ
   + b . 19) where b = 0/1. The negation Œ± in this case is - Œ±‚ÇÄ - b
   . 19. Therefore, we need to add an additional (- b . 19) to -Œ±‚ÇÄ.


Other than these adjustments, subtraction is essentially addition.

(** ** Multiplication

Given two elements a and b with limbs a·µ¢ and b‚±º respectively consider
the associated field element [‚àë a·µ¢ 2·µñ·µíÀ¢ ‚Å±] and [‚àë b‚±º 2·µñ·µíÀ¢  ≤]. The
product is the sum of terms T·µ¢‚±º of the form [a·µ¢ * b‚±º 2·µñ·µíÀ¢ ‚Å± ‚Å∫ ·µñ·µíÀ¢  ≤].
Each of these terms contribute to some limbs, in fact exactly one of
the limbs, in the final product as should be clear from the analysis
below.

For a moment assume that [i + j < 10]. Since [pos i = ‚åà25.5 i‚åâ], we
have [pos (i + j) ‚â§ pos i + pos j ‚â§ pos (i + j) + 1]. We make use of
the inequality ‚åàx + y‚åâ ‚â§ ‚åàx‚åâ + ‚åày‚åâ ‚â§ ‚åàx + y‚åâ + 1. What this means is
that the term T·µ¢‚±º contributes only to the limb [i + j] possibly with
an additional multiplicative factor of 2 (when the second part of the
inequality is actually an equality. When [i+j >= 10] then T·µ¢‚±º similarly
contributes to the limb [i + j mod 10] with the multiplicative factor
being 19 * 2 (because 2¬≤‚Åµ‚Åµ = 19 int the field).

       that the term B[i] * C[j] contributs to A[i+j `mod` 10] but
       needs to be adjusted by a factor of 2 if pos i + pos j > pos (i
       + j).

       Recall that pos i = ‚åà25.5 i ‚åâ therefore for even i pos i = 25.5
       i and for odd i pos i = 25.5 i + 0.5. Doing the case by case
       analysis of i and j we see that pos i + pos j > pos (i + j)
       only when both i and j are odd.
