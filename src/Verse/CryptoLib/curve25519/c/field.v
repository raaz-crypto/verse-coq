(** * Field arithmetic over GF(2¬≤‚Åµ‚Åµ - 19).


In this module, we implement the field arithmetic over the base field
ùîΩ = GF(2¬≤‚Åµ‚Åµ - 19). we start with considering the representation of
elements of this field.


 *)


(** ** Representing elements.


There are two possible representations of elements in this field

* The packed representation as a 255 bit little endian quantity
  represented as 32 bytes. We consider this as 4 -64-bit little endian
  values.

* The computational representation: Consider the 255 bit number in
  base 2‚Åµ¬π as Œ± = x‚ÇÄ + x‚ÇÅ 2‚Åµ¬π .... + x‚ÇÖ 2¬≤‚Å∞‚Å¥. Each of the x·µ¢'s
  themselves can be considered as a·µ¢ + b·µ¢ 2¬≤‚Å∂.


The packed representation is the standard representation and is in
particular used to storing and transmitting values and is thus
canonical.  The computational representation should be treated as an
implementation dependent internal format and is designed to make the
implementation of the field operation efficient.

 *)

(**

In the computable representation, [pos i] represent gives the bit
position from which the ith limb start. The function [pos i]
completely determine the computation presentation. For the finite
field GF(2¬≤‚Åµ‚Åµ - 19), computational representation associated with the
position function [pos i = ‚åà25.5 i‚åâ] is used.

  (** One could generate the instructions for load and store directly,
      however we do it in two steps so that we can prove (more like
      test) some of the basic functions here.

      In the packed form, the bits are treated as 4 √ó little endian
      64bit quantities which amounts to 256 bits of which only 255
      bits are actually relevant when it comes to reduced from. In the
      computation representation, each limb is either 25 or 26
      bits. For each limb x‚±º, we have the following situations
      (mutually exclusive situations)

      * all the bits of x‚±º are within some word w·µ¢

      * The bits of x‚±º are split across two consecutive words w·µ¢ and
        w·µ¢‚Çä‚ÇÅ in which case the lower bits x‚±º come from (the higher
        bits of) w·µ¢ and the higher bits of x‚±º come from (the lower
        bits of) w·µ¢‚Çä‚ÇÅ

        We define an auxiliary data which gives the transfer
        instructions between the ith word w·µ¢ and jth limb x‚±º. The
        constructors are

        * [FullT pos len]: all [len] bits of the limb come from the
        the given word starting at position [pos]

        * [Lower n]: The lower [n] bits of the limb comes from the upper [n] bits
        of the word.

        * [Upper n]: The upper [n] bits of the limb comes from the upper [l] bits

(** * Carry propagation.

During arithmetic operations, limbs can contain more that their
designated number of bits. In such cases we propagate the bits the
next limb (cycling when we reach the last limb *)



Section CarryPropagation.

  Context {progvar : VariableT}.
  Variable limb    : fe progvar.

  Program Definition carryFrom (i : nat)`{i < nLimbs} :=
    if (i =? 9) then [verse| `19` * (limb[9] ‚â´ `len 9`) |]
    else [verse| limb[ i ]  ‚â´ `len i` |].


  Definition propagateTo (i : nat)`(i < nLimbs) : code progvar.
    verse ([code| limb[i] += `carryFrom ((i + nLimbs - 1) mod nLimbs)` |]).
  Defined.

  (* We perform a full cycle of propagation by starting at the highest limb *)
  Definition propagate := foreachLimb propagateTo.

End CarryPropagation.


(** ** How many progagations ?

Firstly checking whether any of the carry is actually zero is not such
a good idea (branching based on secret). So the answer is that we run
the propagate one two many times. In the standard representation, we
want to ensure that the ith limb contains [len i] many bits (rest
needs to be propagated further on. We allow for an additional bit at
the top most limb x‚Çâ which will be adjusted after the end of all
operations. Consider the following arithmetic operations

* _Addition:_ Here there is at most one additional bit generated. So
  the carry from x·µ¢ to x·µ¢‚Çä‚ÇÅ bit. What this means is that if x·µ¢‚Çä‚ÇÅ was
  already of length len (i + 1) at most an additional bit is added to
  it which then is propagated further up.

* _Multiplication:_ If we think of the limbs as forming a polynomial
  over the indeterminate X then the coefficients c‚Çñ (‚àë a·µ¢ X‚Å±)(‚àë b·µ¢ X ≤)
  will be of the form c‚Çñ = 10 terms of the form a·µ¢ b‚±º * 2 * 19. Which
  is bounded by 2‚Åµ¬≤ * 380 = 2‚Å∂¬π and hence are of 61 bits each.

  Now consider the first round of propagation from c‚Çâ to c‚ÇÄ, c‚ÇÄ to c‚ÇÅ
  ...  c‚Çà to c‚Çâ.  When we started each c·µ¢'s had 61 bits at most and
  hence they propagate at most 62 - 25 = 37 bits in each stage. After
  one cycle of propagation c‚ÇÄ to c‚Çà have their correct number of bits
  but c‚Çâ is a 25-bit number + a 37 bit number = 38 bit number. What
  this means is in the next round we will be propagating 38 - 25 = 11
  bits from c‚Çâ to c‚ÇÄ but then on will only be propagating at most 1
  bit; adding a 11-bit carry to a 25 or 26 bit number will result in
  at most have an additional 1 bit carry. As a result after the end of
  the second round of propagation all limbs c‚ÇÄ ... c‚Çà will have the
  correct number of bits but c‚Çâ might have one addition bit (i.e 26
  bits instead of 25 bits). Although this is not the standard
  representation, we do not need to perform any further propagation
  until the final result is desired for, with this bit counts, none of
  our arithmetic operations will overflow.

NOTE: Instead of starting from the largest limb, we could start from
any of the limb but then that particular limb will have an additional
bit. It is better to therefore start the propagation from one of the
25 bit making it 26 bit and our 61 bit bound holds.

(** ** Conditional swapping

Given two field elements A , B and a bit b we want to swap the values
in A and B depending on whether the bit is 1. In order to avoid side
channel information we do the swapping by essentially performing (A,
B) := b B + (1 - b) A, b A + (1 - b) B).

(** ** Field arithmetic operations.

We implement the following operations for field elements.

1. A := B + C or A += B + C.

2. A := B * C of A *= B.

of propagations that is to be done depends on the operations that we
are performing and the context.

(** ** Multiplication

Given two elements a and b with limbs a·µ¢ and b‚±º respectively consider
the associated field element [‚àë a·µ¢ 2·µñ·µíÀ¢ ‚Å±] and [‚àë b‚±º 2·µñ·µíÀ¢  ≤]. The
product is the sum of terms T·µ¢‚±º of the form [a·µ¢ * b‚±º 2·µñ·µíÀ¢ ‚Å± ‚Å∫ ·µñ·µíÀ¢  ≤].
Each of these terms contribute to some limb, in fact exactly one of
the limbs, in the final product as should be clear from the analysis
below.

For a moment assume that [i + j < 10]. Since [pos i = ‚åà25.5 i‚åâ], we
have [pos (i + j) ‚â§ pos i + pos j ‚â§ pos (i + j) + 1]. We make use of
the inequality ‚åàx + y‚åâ ‚â§ ‚åàx‚åâ + ‚åày‚åâ ‚â§ ‚åàx + y‚åâ + 1. What this means is
that the term T·µ¢‚±º contributes only to the limb [i + j] possibly with
an additional multiplicative factor of 2 (when the second part of the
inequality is actually an equality. When [i+j >= 10] then T·µ¢‚±º similarly
contributes to the limb [i + j mod 10] with the multiplicative factor
being 19 * 2 (because 2¬≤‚Åµ‚Åµ = 19 int the field).
