(** * Field arithmetic over GF(2¬≤‚Åµ‚Åµ - 19).


In this module, we implement the field arithmetic over the base field
ùîΩ = GF(2¬≤‚Åµ‚Åµ - 19). we start with considering the representation of
elements of this field.


 *)


(** ** Representing elements.


There are two possible representations of elements in this field

* The packed representation as a 255 bit little endian quantity
  represented as 32 bytes. We consider this as 4 -64-bit little endian
  values.

* The computational representation: Consider the 255 bit number in
  base 2‚Åµ¬π as Œ± = x‚ÇÄ + x‚ÇÅ 2‚Åµ¬π .... + x‚ÇÖ 2¬≤‚Å∞‚Å¥. Each of the x·µ¢'s
  themselves can be considered as a·µ¢ + b·µ¢ 2¬≤‚Å∂.


The packed representation is the standard representation and is in
particular used to storing and transmitting values of the latter and
is thus canonical.  The computational representation should be treated
as an implementation dependent internal format and is designed to make
the implementation of the field operation efficient.

Module Internal.

  (** One could generate the instructions for load and store directly,
      however we do it in two steps so that we can prove (more like
      test) some of the basic functions here.

      In the packed form, the bits are treated as 4 √ó little endian
      64bit quantities which amounts to 256 bits of which only 255
      bits are actually relevant when it comes to reduced from. In the
      computation representation, each limb is either 25 or 26
      bits. For each limb x‚±º, we have the following situations
      (mutually exclusive situations)

      * all the bits of x‚±º are within some word w·µ¢

      * The bits of x‚±º are split across two consecutive words w·µ¢ and
        w·µ¢‚Çä‚ÇÅ in which case the lower bits x‚±º come from (the higher
        bits of) w·µ¢ and the higher bits of x‚±º come from (the lower
        bits of) w·µ¢‚Çä‚ÇÅ

        We define an auxiliary data which gives the transfer
        instructions between the ith word w·µ¢ and jth limb x‚±º. The
        constructors are

        * [FullT pos len]: all [len] bits of the limb come from the
        the given word starting at position [pos]

        * [Lower n]: The lower [n] bits of the limb comes from the upper [n] bits
        of the word.

        * [Upper n]: The upper [n] bits of the limb comes from the upper [l] bits
